# Hello everyone! 
# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal Github profile
- ðŸŽ‡ On December 26th 2021, I started my Github journey. I had been coding for a while before that, but it was the first time I had ever posted my code on the internet for the general public to see.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on Python, and know some Turtle and Tkinter
- ðŸ˜„ I'm a beginner Python programmer, and am working on developing my biggest project, DigiBingo, into a Tkinter-based programme
