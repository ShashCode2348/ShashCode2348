# Hello everyone! 
# 👋 Welcome to my personal Github profile
- 🎇 On December 26th 2021, I started my Github journey. I had been coding for a while before that, but it was the first time I had ever posted my code on the internet for the general public to see.
- 🔭 I am currently working on Python, and know some Turtle and Tkinter
- 😄 I'm a beginner Python programmer, and am working as a coder in NetFruitTechnologies
