# Hello everyone! 
# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal Github profile
- ðŸŽ‡ On December 26th 2021, I started my Github journey. I had been coding for a while before that, but it was the first time I had ever posted my code on the internet for the general public to see.
- ðŸ”­ I have coded many projects in Python, and know GUI like Turtle and Tkinter
- ðŸ”­ I know how to code in Python and C++
- ðŸ˜„ I'm a Python programmer, and am working as a coder in NetFruitTechnologies
